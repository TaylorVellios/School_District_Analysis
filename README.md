# School_District_Analysis
Python Pandas

## Overview
An analysis of math and reading scores for highschools across an entire school district.<br>
In this scenario we have been informed of the possibility of academic dishonesty regarding a specific school's scores.<br>
We will be taking a look at the school district as a whole and how the information changes with and without the questionable data.

* The District Summary above as well as the School Summary below have been calculated after removing 9th grade scores from Thomas High School.<br>
* Whatever the values were, I used pandas .loc to convert 9th grade data from THS to NaN.
* At our birds-eye view in the District Summary, we can see a trend of greater student aptitude towards Reading compared to Math, as we zoom in we will confirm this.
